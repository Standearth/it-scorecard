Hala Khouri,"Co-founder, Off The Mat","Climate change threatens our future and we all have to do our part to reduce emissions, including lululemon.",hala.jpg
Rev. angel Kyodo Williams ,Transformative Change,"Like so many yoga teachers, I expect that lululemon's clear commitment to brand excellence extends to a commitment to the health and wellbeing of planet and people. lululemon can and should do the right thing",revangel.jpg
Dr. Shyam Ranganathan,Yoga Philosophy,"Before yoga was a commodity that Lululemon could profit off, it was, in ancient times, the original philosophy of decolonization, which aimed at interrupting systemic harm to make room for independent persons. If Lululemon wants to make money off of yoga, it ought to embody the practice of yoga, and do its part to disrupt climate change by, for starters, divesting from coal.",shyam.jpg
Yogacharini Maitreyi ,Arkaya Awareness,I signed the letter to lululemon because the pollution from the production of lululemon's apparel is a threat both to human health and climate change. Lululemon’s failure to address the health and climate impacts of its supply chain is out of alignment with the company’s values and brand promise. I invite the yoga community to join me in signing the letter asking lululemon to quit coal and go renewable by 2030.,yogacharini.jpg
Suzanne Sterling,Voice of Change and Art of Ritual Trainings,"I have seen first hand the way in which the yoga community can and must be a force and a voice for change that is in alignment with the basic teachings and values of the practice itself.  It is through the practice of yoga that we can release the grip of fear, competition and mindless consumerism and do the work of self inquiry that leads to true compassion for the suffering of others and the earth and a sense of responsibility to take conscious action.  It is time for all of us; teachers, students and yoga business owners to take leadership in standing for living the values of yoga in ALL that we do.  Given their visibility, Lululemon can and should RIGHT NOW be at the forefront of actions that are forward thinking and life sustaining.",suzanne.jpg
Kennae Miller,Transformation Yoga,"As yogis we know that the outward manifestation of what happens to the Earth is a reflection of what is happening within. We have a responsibility to buy clothing and equipment from reputable and regenerative brands and call into question and hold accountable brands that continue to succeed because of our funding by challenging them to do their part in climate change. We borrow this planet from our children and if we are determined to leave a planet for them to inherit, it is imperative that we do our part and stop the use of coal, which contributes to the decline of our climate.",kennae.jpg
Nadine McNeil,Universal Empress,"I can still recall my first pair of yoga pants I ever bought from Lululemon, over 15 years ago.  I loved them and wore them proudly.  Now almost 20 years later, as a yoga student-teacher, my primary mission is to live from a place of conscious awareness. This is the premise upon which call upon this major stakeholder in the yoga industry to engage in more earth-friendly, renewable manufacturing processes.  Millions of people across the planet practicing yoga in attire that is produced irresponsibly defies the very essence and hallmarks of yoga; taking full responsibility for one's actions.",nadine.jpg
Tias Little,Prajna Yoga,"Every student of yoga, while sustaining their own somatic ecology, must work to help sustain the ecology of the precious planet we walk on. Burning coal to make hoodies and ‘Hotty Hot’ high-rise pants is unacceptable. This pulls yoga down into the fires of mindless greed and consumption. I am glad to support this much needed public presentation around the global crisis of coal and specifically the tact Lululemon has made to exploit this.",tias.jpg
Sierra Hollister,Living Yoga,"Right action, recognizing all manifestations of life as equal – this is true devotion. To care for earth and each other is a fundamental part of living our yoga. I’m calling on lululemon to embody right action and quit coal and commit to renewable energy. All life is imperiled by climate change and lululemon is well-positioned as one of the largest yoga apparel manufacturers in the world to have an impact on climate and change industry standards. That’s a win / win by any standard.",sierra.jpg
Tina Pashumati James,Loka Yoga,"As Carl Sagan once said, 'Coal is a  fossil fuel, because it is mostly made of the fossil remains of beings from long ago. The chemical energy within them is a kind of stored sunlight originally accumulated by ancient plants. Our civilization runs by burning the remains of humble creatures who inhabited the Earth hundreds of millions of years before the first humans came on the scene. Like some ghastly cannibal cult, we subsist on the dead bodies of our ancestors and distant relatives.' lululemon should divest from fossil fuel and invest in renewable energy.",tina.jpg
Jennifer Tan,"Yoga Instructor, an Educator and a former lululemon Ambassador ","As a former lululemon ambassador whose individual voice was not always heard, I feel a collective calling is necessary in order to facilitate meaningful change. lululemon has the power and resources to make significant shifts in how it operates - not only from a climate crisis perspective, but from an intersectional stance, too. It is encouraging to see so many names on the petition, and I encourage others to join this invitation, for those in power to have their values and actions align with one another.",jennifer.jpg
Miles Borrero,Miles Yoga,"One of the lead tenants of yoga is ahimsa, the practice of 'doing the least amount of harm'. Lululemon makes a living through its connection to yoga. As an avid advocate for our planet, I have signed along with many other yoga teachers, for lululemon to move from its coal dependency toward renewable energy by 2030. We must be the changemakers, and we can't stop the effects of climate change without commitment from these big corporations. Sign the petition if you'd like to join me.",miles.jpg
Carmen Ana Hernandez-Esquijarosa,Carmen Ana Yoga,Our relationship with the planet is an extension of our relationship with ourselves. We must transition to sustainable ways of living and the conscious community should be leading the way.,carmenana.jpg
Danielle Hoogenboom ,Love Light Yoga,"Lululemon has the resources, innovation and people power to activate deep change in the world. It has a real opportunity to demonstrate yogic principles and values and inspire their brand lovers and ambassadors to do the same. Now is the time!",danielle.jpg
Joanna Benn,Every Body Yoga,"We need to halve global emissions in the next 8 years if we are to have a liveable Earth. We must, as yoga practitioners, lead through ahimsa, non-harming and make every effort along the supply chain and in all our actions to do the right, if sometimes, more challenging thing. Coal is not clean. It’s time to go 100% renewable.",joanna.jpg
Galen Thromble,Climate Yogi,"To end the climate crisis, everything matters, even how our clothes are made. I urge lululemon to bring its supply chain's climate impacts in line with its environmental and social values by committing to quit coal and transition to 100% renewable by 2030.",galen.jpg
Julia Crouch,MatressenceYoga.com,I haven’t shopped at lululemon for years and never will unless it change its practices.,julia.jpg
Jane DoCampo,My Back and Body Clinic,"Given the pressing need to curtail climate change, it is vital to make choices that support the well-being of the planet and to speak out to encourage all to comply.",jane.jpg
Marianne Manilov,Engage Network,"We are facing a polycrisis: climate, democracy at risk, racial justice/capitalism, intertwined systems. Yoga is a practice to build strength and love and fire to create inner and outer change both on and off the mat. Lululemon can not profit off of the practice of yoga and not stand for what yoga is. It is time for Lululemon to act.",marianne.jpg
